$(TYPEDEF)
$(TYPEDFIELDS)
Label of a net or page that holds zero or more declarations. The declarations are used
to define parts of the many-sorted algebra used by High-Level Petri Nets.
Other PNTDs may introduce non-standard uses for declarations.

# Notes
`declarations` is implemented as a collection of `Any`
We can use infrastructure implemented for HL nets to provide nonstandard extensions.
