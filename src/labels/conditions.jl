Label a Transition with an boolean expression used to determine when/if the transition fires.

There may be other things evaluating to boolean used to determine transition firing filters,
including: priority labels, inhibitor arc, place capacity labels, time/delay labels.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup=:(using PNML; using PNML: BooleanConstant)
julia> c = PNML.Labels.Condition(false)
Condition("", BooleanEx(BooleanConstant(false)))

julia> c()
false

julia> c = PNML.Labels.Condition("xx", BooleanEx(BooleanConstant(true)))
Condition("xx", BooleanEx(BooleanConstant(true)))

julia> c()
true
```

    # arc inscription expressions have variable arguments as do conditions.

    # vars are ordered collections in standard! It uses Abstract Math and UML2 to say so.
    # They are the arguments to operators (expressions with variables), so the need to be consistent.

    # 0-ary operators are constants and literals (as ground terms without variables).
    # Rewriting should optimize/minimize these terms.

    # There will be inscriptions in preset(t) that are ground terms (constant or literal).
    # Use in postset is the obvious case: generate token.
    # A preset ground term inscription will not have a variable and use a multiplicity = 1.
    # Value will be of the basis sort (like all inscriptions).
