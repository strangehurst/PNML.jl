A label may be associated with a node, an arc, or the net itself.

Things that are not labels (will be found as part of label's content) include Terms, Sorts.

Declarations are global labels of a High-level Petri Net attached to net or page and
used for defining variables, and user-defined sorts and operators.

Meta-models define the labels of the respective Petri net type (pntd).

Note: concepts of sorts, operators, declarations, and terms,
and how terms are constructed from variables and operators.
Implies this is 4 or 6 distinct things.

sort of a term is the sort of the variable or the output sort of the operator.

Declarations ? declarationslabel holding sort, variable, operator

built-in sorts and operators (sorts have associated operators)
- Multisets
- Booleans
- Finite Enumerations, Cyclic Enumerations, and Finite Integer Ranges
- Partitions allow the definition of finite enumerations that are partitioned into sub-ranges
- Integer
- Strings
- Lists

user-defined variables are defined in a variable declaration

sort of Term is output sort of Operator or sort of Variable

operator can be: built-in constant, built-in operator, multiset operator, or tuple operator.

arbitrary sorts and operators
... introduce a new symbol without giving a definition
... used for constructing terms

Unparsed term ... text, which will not be parsed and interpreted by the toolinfos

P/T Nets defined as restricted HLPNGs
- sorts Bool and Dot only.
- type of each place must refer to sort Dot
- no user declarations, nor variables, nor sorts, nor operators.
- transition conditions need to be the constant true, if this label is present.
- arc annotations and the initial markings are ground terms of the mulitset sort over Dot.

Symmetric Nets
- sort of a place must not be a multiset sort
-  for every sort, there is the operator all, which is a multiset that contains exactly one element of its basis sort

High-Level Petri Net Graphs extends Symmetric Nets
- declarations for sorts and functions
- additional built-in sorts for Integer, String, and List.
