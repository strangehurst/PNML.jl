# Term is an abstract element in the pnml standard with no XML tag, we call that `AbstractTrm`.
# As part of the many-sorted algebra atta of a High-level Petri Net Graph,
# Terms are contained within the <structure> element of a label.
# One XML child is expected below <structure> in the PNML schema.
# The child's XML tag is used as the AST node type symbol.
