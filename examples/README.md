# Examples Directory

Besides usage examples of the PNML Julia package, 
there are exploration and experimental bits found here.

There is a Julia environment provided. Is it up-to-date?

Usage of a bit is as a script or via include in a REPL. Examples:

```
cd examples
julia lotka-volterra.jl
```
```
cd examples
julia
include("warntype.jl")
```

It may be useful to run from vscode or juno [, emacs...] to 
display plots and other output. See the comments about environment.
