  - Parser creates TermInterface objects.
  - Variable substitution works. Uses `Expr`.
  - Enabling rule works for SymmetricNets.
  - Firing rule works for PN_HLPNG; NOT FOR SymmetrinNet or HLPNG
  - Testing is missing, refactoring still proceeding.

First tagged version is 0.0.6. This is before much high-level function.
