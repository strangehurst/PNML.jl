# Traits

Some of the traits used are based on the pntd.
Each supported pntd has a singleton subtype of PnmlType.

3 branches of pntd based on number system
  - _core_ uses integers
  - _high-level_ uses terms of many-sorted algebra
  - _continuous/hybrid_ uses floating point

Default place markings and arc inscriptions are different for the three.
